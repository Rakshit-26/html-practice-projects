<UL TYPE="CIRCLE"><LI><A NAME="S"></A><H3>Schooling</H3></LI></UL><font size="4">
At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school. When Gates was in the eighth grade,
 the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype 
Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's
 students. Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math 
classes to pursue his interest. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software 
code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the
 machine." After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems
 including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center 
Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students – Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans
 – for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.
At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra 
computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype[clarification needed], Gates went to CCC's offices and
 studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and
 machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business.
 The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in
 COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his 
programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. 
He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with "a disproportionate number of interesting girls.
"He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously 
demonstrate success." At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic 
counters based on the Intel 8008 processor. In 1972, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the 
U.S. House of Representatives.
Gates was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 
1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.

<UL TYPE="CIRCLE"><LI><A NAME="HHLH"></A><H3>How He Left Harvard</H3></LI></UL>
<font size="4">
 Despite pulling good grades, he dropped out of Harvard University in 1975 to go cofound Microsoft,
 setting him on the path to becoming the wealthiest man in the world.
In a new interview with Bloomberg, Gates says that he doesn't have many regrets. He says he liked lots of
 things about college - <b>"There were smart people around, and they fed you, and they gave you these nice 
grades that made you feel smart"</b> - but he doesn't think he missed out on much.
<b>"It was unfortunate that I didn't get to stay there, but I don't think I missed any knowledge, because whatever I 
needed to learn, I was still in a learning mode,"</b> Gates says. 
In other words, Gates says that his well-known love of reading (he reads 50 books a year), taking online classes,
 and generally expanding his mind by any means available more than makes up for anything he missed out on at Harvard. 
<b>"I'm kind a weird dropout because I take college courses all the time,"</b> Gates says.<b> "I love being a student."</b>
It also does seem like Gates has evolved his thinking on college - despite his own status as a dropout, 
his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has made affordable college eduction a big priority, even as it's
 become a big point of policy for politicians. He recently said the value of a college degree is "easy to underestimate." 
Besides, in 2007, Gates returned to Harvard to accept an honorary degree. </font><br><br>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE="4">
With a net worth of more than $90 billion, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is the second richest person in the world, 
behind only Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to Forbes. He has so much money, in fact, that it has become a 
full-time job for him, his wife, Melinda, and 1,500 employees of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to give it all away.
So why do the Gates work so hard to give their billions to philanthropy? In the couple's 10th annual letter 
describing their foundation's charity work released Tuesday, the billionaires opened up about the subject.
It provides purpose
"There are two reasons to do something like this," the letter says, referring to the $4 billion a year the foundation
 spends in developing countries trying to end child mortality, distribute vaccinations and improve access to education, plus another $500 million it shells out in the United States.
First, "it's meaningful work," according to the letter.
"Even before we got married, we talked about how we would eventually spend a lot of time on philanthropy," writes Bill.
 "We think that's a basic responsibility of anyone with a lot of money. Once you've taken care of yourself and your 
children, the best use of extra wealth is to give it back to society."
To that end, the Gates have also co-founded The Giving Pledge with their billionaire buddy 
Warren Buffett. The platform invites billionaires to commit to giving away the majority of their money to charity.

1.<U>Settlers of Catan</U><BR>
This civilization-building board game is a favorite in his family. Melinda, his kids, and he have spent many hours
 sitting around the table trading resources, building roads, and strategizing to be the first to reach 10 victory points.
<BR><BR>

2.<U>Tennis</U><BR>
He have played tennis his whole life. This year, he got to play a match with Roger Federer to help raise money
 for his foundation. He wouldn’t say it was the most relaxing tennis game I’ve ever played, but it was a whole 
lot of fun.<BR><BR>

3.<U>Reading Books</U><BR>
It may not be too surprising that one of his favorite ways to relax is to keep learning. On average, he tries 
to read a book a week, and he always bring a whole tote bag of them on vacation.<BR><BR>

4.<U>Travel</U><BR>
In 1993, Melinda and he visited Tanzania, Kenya, and Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). After travelling he 
felt that it’s not possible for everyone to travel halfway around the world, 
so he have started sharing VR videos on his Gates Notes blog (<A href="https://www.gatesnotes.com"> Click here to
 go on this blog </A>) of what he is seeing and learning.<BR><BR>

1. As a teen at Lakeside Prep School, Gates wrote his first computer program on a General Electric computer.
 It was a version of tic-tac-toe where you could play against the machine.<br>
2. Gates also read the entire "World Book Encyclopedia" series during his teenage years.<br>
3. Like many other successful tech entrepreneurs, Gates was a college dropout.
 He left Harvard University in 1975 to fully devote himself to Microsoft.<br>
4. Two years after he dropped out of Harvard, Gates was arrested in New Mexico.
 He was driving without a license and ran a red light.<br>
5. Speaking of cars, Gates has quite the Porsche collection.
 The headliner is his Porsche 959 sports car, which he bought 13 years before the car was
 approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency or the US Department of Transportation.<br>
6. Besides his plane, one of Gates' biggest splurges was the Codex Leicester, a collection of 
writings by Leonardo da Vinci. He acquired it at a 1994 auction for $30.8 million.<br>
7. Gates says he reads 50 books a year. "Reading is still the main way that I both learn
 new things and test my understanding," he says.<br></FONT>
